    "\n",
    "**注意：本章节为可选内容，未包含在 FOSS4G 2024 Workshop 中**\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你还有时间，或者希望在本地环境中继续学习，本章节仍然非常值得参考。\n",
    "需要注意的是，相关的服务容器**只能在本地（Docker）环境中运行**，\n",
    "无法通过云端的 Workshop Binder 版本来执行。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你希望更深入地使用 pygeoapi，我们也非常推荐你参考我们的完整工作坊：\n",
    "[Diving into pygeoapi](https://dive.pygeoapi.io)，\n",
    "该工作坊通常也会在 FOSS4G 2023 等会议中提供。\n",

    "## 概述\n",
    "\n",
    "**数据发布（Dissemination）** 是任何地理空间数据管理生命周期中的关键环节，\n",
    "而 **互联网** 则是与他人共享数据的核心通道。\n",
    "\n",
    "如今，将数据发布到 Web 上从未如此简单：\n",
    "无论是 Google、GitHub、Amazon、Azure、DigitalOcean 等云服务，\n",
    "还是大量支持通过 **应用程序接口（API）** 发布数据的工具生态，\n",
    "都极大降低了数据发布的门槛。\n",
    "\n",
    "地理空间数据的发布在复杂度上存在较大差异：\n",
    "从简单地将文件放到 Web 服务器上，\n",
    "到部署完整的数据服务和 API，\n",
    "都属于常见且可行的发布方式。\n",
    "\n",
    "在本章节中，我们将聚焦于**基础的数据与元数据发布流程**，主要使用：\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io)  \n",
    "  （支持多种 [OGC API](https://ogcapi.org) 标准）\n",
    "- [pycsw](https://pycsw.org)  \n",
    "  （支持 OGC Web 目录服务规范 —— Catalogue Service for the Web，简称 **CSW**）\n",
    "\n",
    "因此，整体的基础工作流如下所示：\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "数据发布     -> pygeoapi -> OGC API 客户端\n",
    "元数据发布   -> pycsw    -> OGC CSW 与 OGC API - Records 客户端\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "关于这些服务以及如何与它们进行远程交互的更多示例，\n",
    "将在第 10 和第 11 节中介绍。\n",
    "\n",
    "在本示例中，我们使用的是\n",
    "[WMO WOUDC](https://woudc.org)\n",
    "提供的\n",
    "[臭氧与紫外线监测站列表](https://woudc.org/data/stations)\n",
    "（数据获取时间：2021-09-14）。\n",
    "\n",
    "相关数据文件位于：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 数据文件：`../data/woudc-stations.geojson`\n",
    "- 元数据文件：`../data/woudc-stations.mcf`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 运行服务\n",
    "\n",
    "在开始之前，你需要先运行 `pygeoapi` 和 `pycsw` 服务。\n",
    "\n",
    "请在 `workshop` 目录下的终端（shell）中执行以下命令：\n",
    "\n",
    "* start: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up -d`\n",
    "* stop: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml stop`\n",
    "\n",
    "(如果你的 Docker 版本要求使用新语法，也可以将 docker-compose 替换为 docker compose)。"
